// pathfinding in realtime, although you could perhaps cache a few generic paths
// between evenly distributed positions within a level...
//


// NOTE: Perhaps we could make this even smaller... in practice, a path will
// never run through every possible coordinate in a level, and a level with no
// gaps whatsoever is unlikely to be generated in the first place...
//
// Also, we do not generate tiles for the borders of the map.
